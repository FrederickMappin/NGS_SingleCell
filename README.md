# Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Analysis
Overview
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for the examination of gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. This enables researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell types, and understand gene expression variability within complex tissues.

This package provides tools for analyzing and visualizing scRNA-seq data, including preprocessing, quality control, clustering, and differential expression analysis. It's designed to work with raw count matrices and includes functions to facilitate the typical steps in an scRNA-seq analysis pipeline.
